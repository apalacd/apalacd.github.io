                <p>I have led and participated in small to medium size enterprise system implementations and expanded into operations processes and efficiencies. In recent years, I have been an integral team-member in projects that involve collaborating and interacting with customers, UX research, Analytics, Content creation strategies, SEO and Digital Marketing objectives, strategies and KPI's within Agile frameworks to explore, and learn about these avenues.</p>

                <h3>Google Analytics, SEO and Digital Marketing within Scaled-Agile framework</h3>

                    <p>I have learned and implemented Google Analytics and integrated it with a content management system(CMS) and learning management system(LMS) word-press website(Pro-bono project)  within Scaled-Agile Framework. I have run user traffic analytics for the website and developed insights and dashboard with custom reports. I've created KPI's to measure metrics alignment with goals and presented the story to the Stakeholders and teams in the Sprint review meetings towards the end of the four weeks Sprint cycle. I have collaborated with the marketing team in creating strategies to increase engagement, acquisition and retention rates of visitors and blog contributors, and track conversions from visitors to signups. I have researched, assessed, tested, and made actionable recommendations on digital marketing strategies to be incorporated into content creation, development, schema and site infrastructure, to the respective Scrum sub-teams. This improved SEO, drove more organic traffic to the site, increased numbers of conversions in form of signups, donations to support the community program and retention of readers and blog contributers over the time. 
                        
                    I have also written and shared blogs, articles, created visual graphic content on Project Management practices and methodologies using Canva and Figma tools.
