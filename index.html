                <h2 id="first-section">About Me...</h2>

                <p>I am a Business Analyst and techno-functional leader with a demonstrated history of working in the IT and business operations. By nature, I am curious, creative, analytical with interpersonal and communication skills. I am able to influence Stakeholders and collaborate with diverse technical and non-technical teams to deliver solutions for customer needs.</p>

                <p>I am customer obsessed, empathetic, active listener and like to collaborate with External and Internal Customers to understand their pain points and needs. My curiosity to learn compounded with my business and technical knowledge, enables me to make or advise on business process and system improvements with effective outcomes. I can work individually, however, I enjoy working in cross-functional team environments which present opportunities to collaborate, learn from each other and work as a team to achieve our common objective of delivering value to the customer.</p>

                <p>In the past, I have successfully managed and led small to medium size implementation of application software products and upgrades including stand-alone projects, and specific tracks of larger programs. I have cultivated business relationships, partnered with business and technical teams and led with strategic thinking. With the collaboration, I was able to identify opportunities and drove innovative solutions that worked for internal and external customers, hence, contributing towards the company's welfare and growth.</p>

                <p>I am a passionate learner with a growth mind-set. I love to learn and acquire new skills to diversify my knowledge. I research and learn whatever it takes to resolve issues presented to me. I am resilient in solving problems under complex situations. I have a good understanding of cultural diversity and sensitivity. My associates, colleagues and managers recognize me as a curious, creative problem solver with a positive attitude, an agile, versatile and amicable team-player who is adept at leveraging skills to work with both business and technical groups.</p>
